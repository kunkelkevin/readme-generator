  ## Description
  The readme generator create a high quality readme file base on user input from the command line.  There is options to include a title, description, installation, usage, contribution, test, license, and contact information of GitHub and email.  There is an option to get more detailed instructions to display to better understand what needs to be included within each section.  Each input is placed within it's own defined section, and a table of contents is created that links to the appropriate section.  The chosen license will display a badge below the title and give details pertaining to that license, plus a link that will give more details about the chosen license.  The GitHub username and email address will be added into a questions sections as contact information.

  ## Table of Contents

Then the program should be available to execute with "node index.js".
